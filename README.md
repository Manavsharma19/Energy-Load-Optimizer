This project implements **predictive analysis** to estimate the heating and cooling loads of buildings based on specific characteristics such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution.

Using** polynomial regression** with cross-validation, the project identifies the optimal polynomial degree for accurate predictions. The evaluation process includes calculating mean absolute differences between predicted and actual loads across multiple cross-validation folds. 

The project encompasses data loading and preprocessing, **regression modeling**, **accuracy evaluation**, and **result visualization**, providing a comprehensive approach to analyzing and predicting energy loads for buildings, making it valuable for **energy efficiency assessments and optimization efforts**.
